  "input_transcript": "Texas Car Guy, when you look three to five years in the future, how do you see car sales changing? You know, I think, just coming back from NADA, I saw two things that were very, prominent throughout the whole conference. One was AI, and two is social media. It looks like they were taking over. I mean, I've never seen content creators at a conference like this before. They were all over, myself included, right? So, I think it's important people are going to social media platforms now to buy cars. And so, we've got to make ourselves relevant as car dealers. Cool. Yeah. Alright. If you were ava sorry. If you're advising a car dealership today how to sell more cars through social media, what would you tell them? Well, I think you've got to get involved. You've got to find there's key people in your dealership, I think, everywhere that that can really dive in, that are, like, not afraid to do it. For those that are afraid to do it, you've gotta dive in. Right? I use this scenario all the time about how how are diamonds made. Right? It's a rough process that you go through, but at the end, it's beautiful. And I think that's our industry right now. I mean, we've got to get out of our comfort zone, we've got to start selling cars way different than we have been. Cool. Thank you. All right. Last one. A big challenge for car dealership a big challenge for car dealership salespeople is staying consistent on posting online. So how can a tool like Markey help them stay consistent and sell more cars? I'll tell you, I love My Marquee because I can batch content. And if you don't know what that is, I mean, you're you're behind the eight ball, I think. So filming multiple videos at one time, posting them into My Marquee AI, and it it really allows you to kinda set it and forget it. You can build your own content, post it in the calendar, and it automatically posts. Like, I know when I'm home, I can look around, I don't know, a certain time, whatever time I tell it to post, and I go, oh, there's my video. And if not, great customer service. I know if I need help, my Marquee is gonna help me out. Awesome. Thank you. I I recommend it to everyone. Cool. Awesome. Okay. So as the last thing, I'm gonna have you record a couple hooks. Yeah. So, these, I'll use to prepend to what you just said. So it's more of a little bit of a scripted thing. You're gonna say something like this. In five years, the way most dealership sells cars is gonna look completely different. Okay. Yeah? Yep. So you can kinda say that to me. Yeah. Yeah. In five years, the way dealerships sell cars are gonna be completely different. Great. Next one, if you're not using social media to sell cars, you're already behind whether you know it or not. Okay. If you're not using social media to sell cars, you're already behind, whether you know it or not. Okay. And the last one is, the next generation of car buyers is not walking onto the lot first. They're opening Instagram. Yeah. The next generation of buyers are not walking on the lot. Gosh. They're not even going on Google. They're going to Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, all the social media platforms. Sweet. Alright. I think that's it. Let me just make sure. You down for two more, hooks? I can do whatever you want, man. Alright. Here. My Marquee is here for Texas Car Guy. Yeah. You guys here for My Marquee. Okay. So this is for the second one. Which hook do you like best? Okay. Yeah. Which one? Yeah. You don't need better ads. You need better presence. Good. Okay. And then for the third one, one Absolutely. Say that again. Yeah. Yeah. You don't need better ads. You need better online presence. Nice. Yeah. And then one of these. K. Just keep it right there. Mhmm. So is is this voice. Right? Mhmm. Oh, no. This will be recorded. Oh, it'll be recorded? Okay. It'll be a hooker. Yeah. Maybe the dealerships that win every day are those that show up every day? Yeah. Yeah? You like that? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the dealerships that win every day are the dealerships that that's a mouthful, right? The dealerships that win every day are the dealerships that show up every day. Boom. That's it. Yeah.",
