1. PROFILE — Build a Scientific Brand, Buyer & Content Strategy Model

Objective:
Ensure content targets the right people with the right message at the right time — and that there is a deliberate strategy driving every piece of content.

What you do here
	•	Deep onboarding interviews (you + brand expert)
	•	Clarify the ICP:
	•	Who buys (demographics, firmographics, psychographics)
	•	Buyer jobs, pains, gains (JTBD framework)
	•	Customer journey & buying triggers
	•	Why people actually buy (real reasons, not aspirational ones)
	•	Define the founder's content authority:
	•	Topics they know deeply
	•	Topics they enjoy talking about
	•	Topics they have earned authority in
	•	Build the content strategy:
	•	Content pillars — 3–5 thematic lanes that map to ICP interests and founder authority
	•	Content mix — ratio of educational / storytelling / POV / social proof
	•	Funnel intent — where each pillar sits in the awareness → trust → conversion journey
	•	Platform strategy — which platforms get what type of content and why
	•	Set brand boundaries:
	•	What not to talk about
	•	Tone & voice guardrails
	•	Competitive positioning constraints

Outputs
	•	A structured Brand Profile containing:
	•	ICP definition
	•	Jobs / pains / gains
	•	Content pillars with rationale
	•	Content strategy & mix
	•	Messaging guidelines
	•	Content constraints & boundaries
	•	This becomes:
	•	A custom GPT — the "brain" for everything downstream
	•	Visualized as a brand bento-card style UI
	•	Clear, inspectable, non-hand-wavy

Why this is scientific:
You're anchoring everything to buyer psychology, JTBD, and a deliberate content strategy — not trends or intuition. Every piece of content ties back to a pillar, and every pillar ties back to the ICP.
