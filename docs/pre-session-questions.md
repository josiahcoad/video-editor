# Pre-session questions that turn into video ideas

Send a short list before a recording session (e.g. "Pumped for our session today. Quick prep: …") to surface answers that become hooks, angles, and one-video-one-topic ideas. Use what fits the client; you don't need all of them.

## Stories & proof (angles and examples)

- What's a **mistake you see** that costs people the most (time, money, opportunity)?
- **Can you give me an example?** (When they give a generality, ask this to get a concrete story — Marketing Show Runners.)

## Expert POV (authority, clarity)

- What's the **first thing you look for** when [assessing / on a discovery call with] a new client?
- What do people usually **need to hear** before they're ready to [buy / work with you]?

## For short-form clips (specificity over generality)

- Ask **open-ended** first ("Tell me about X" / "How did it feel when…").
- If the answer is vague: **"Can you give me an example?"**
- If still no story: **"Put them in a box"** — describe a very specific scenario (A, B, C, D) and ask "So what was E?" so they fill in one concrete detail. (Marketing Show Runners.)
- **One post, one focus** — the best clips have a single takeaway or CTA. (Marketers Do Coffee.)

---

## Optional: human / personality (if brand allows)

- What do you love about what you do that has **nothing to do with money or success**? (Podcast Prompts — contrasting perspective.)
- What's something **other people over-value** that you don't? (Podcast Prompts.)
- What's a recent time you **broke a rule** and feel good about it? (Podcast Prompts — bold, shareable.)
