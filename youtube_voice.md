# YouTube: Titles, Descriptions & Thumbnails

Guidelines for creating high-CTR YouTube content. These rules apply to both long-form and Shorts.

---

## THUMBNAILS

### The Formula

A thumbnail is two things working together: **a face** and **a punch**.

1. **Face fills 40-60% of the frame.** Always a real human face showing a specific emotion — not a neutral headshot. The face tells the viewer how to feel before they read anything.
2. **2-3 words of bold text.** Not a sentence. Not a title. A punch. The text creates a question the viewer needs answered.
3. **One visual element** that adds context — a graph, a product, an arrow, a before/after, an X vs checkmark.

### Emotion Library

Pick the emotion that matches the video's angle:

| Emotion | When to use | Face expression |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Shock / disbelief | Something unexpected or contrarian | Wide eyes, open mouth, hands on head |
| Confidence | Teaching, authority, "I know something you don't" | Slight smirk, direct eye contact, arms crossed |
| Skepticism | Debunking, questioning conventional wisdom | Raised eyebrow, slight frown, pointing at something |
| Urgency | Time-sensitive, "you need to know this" | Intense stare, leaning forward |
| Vulnerability | Personal story, lessons learned, honest reflection | Soft expression, looking slightly off-camera |

### Text Rules

- **MAX 3 words.** If you need 4+, cut harder.
- Text should be a **fragment**, not a complete thought: "PICK ONE", "it's over", "100x FASTER", "Just Start"
- Bold, high contrast, readable at 120px wide (phone screen)
- Never repeat the title — the thumbnail text and the title tell DIFFERENT halves of the story

### Visual Contrast

Use one of these tension patterns:
- **X vs checkmark** (wrong way vs right way)
- **Before → after arrows** (transformation)
- **Quoted text** in a highlight color (implies something controversial was said)
- **Split frame** (two opposing ideas side by side)
- **Simplified diagram** (take a complex framework and reduce it to 2-3 shapes)

### Technical Specs

- 1280x720 minimum (16:9)
- File size under 2MB
- Avoid text in bottom-right corner (timestamp overlay)
- Test readability at small size — if you can't read the text in the YouTube sidebar, it's too small
- High saturation / contrast — thumbnails compete with dozens of others on screen

### What NOT to Do

- No cluttered designs with 5+ elements
- No full sentences as text overlay
- No stock photos or generic imagery
- No logos taking up prime real estate
- No dark/muddy colors that blend into YouTube's dark mode
- No thumbnail that could be ANY video — it should only make sense for THIS video

## TITLES

### The Formula

The title gives **context** that the thumbnail doesn't. Together, they create a curiosity gap that only clicking can resolve.

### Patterns That Work

1. **Casual lowercase** — feels human, not corporate
   - "watch this if you're tired of being broke"
   - "I helped 200K businesses. They all make this mistake."
   - "stop posting the same thing on every platform."

2. **Bold claim + question mark** — challenges something obvious
   - "Ethernet is DEAD??"
   - "Social media reach doesn't matter anymore?"

3. **Number + category** — promises structured value
   - "26 Harsh Lessons I Learned in 2025"
   - "13 Years of No BS Business Advice in 79 Mins"

4. **How-to with a specific outcome** — promises transformation
   - "How To Actually Get Rich In Your 20s"
   - "How I Post to 6 Platforms Without Burning Out"

5. **Curiosity gap** — reveals just enough to create a question
   - "This New Pyramid Theory Explains the Missing Evidence"
   - "Bill Gates just got caught in 4K.."

### Title Rules

- 50-70 characters (longer gets truncated on mobile)
- Title and thumbnail NEVER repeat each other
- Front-load the interesting part — mobile truncates after ~50 chars
- Use sentence case or lowercase, not ALL CAPS (unless it's a single word for emphasis)
- Include 1-2 searchable keywords naturally (not keyword-stuffed)

### What NOT to Do

- No clickbait that the video doesn't deliver on — retention will tank
- No generic titles that could apply to any video ("My Thoughts on Social Media")
- No repeating the thumbnail text
- No all-caps titles (feels desperate)
- No pipes or brackets for SEO hacks ("Social Media Strategy | 2026 Guide [FREE]")

## DESCRIPTIONS

Descriptions don't drive clicks. Don't overthink them. The best creators use a **reusable template** and swap in minimal video-specific content at the top.

### Structure

```
[1-2 line hook or CTA — the only thing visible before "Show More"]

[Timestamps if the video is 5+ minutes]

[Reusable template: links, bio, socials, legal]
```

### The First Line

The only part anyone sees without clicking "Show More." Use it for:
- A strong CTA with a link (lead magnet, free resource, product)
- OR a 1-line hook that extends the title's curiosity gap

**Good:**
> Download the free Reach vs Trust framework: https://mymarky.ai/framework

**Also good:**
> Every platform does two things differently. Most people use them the same way.

**Bad:**
> In this video, I talk about social media strategy. Like and subscribe!

### Timestamps

Include timestamps for videos over 5 minutes. They:
- Improve SEO (Google shows them in search results)
- Increase watch time (people jump to relevant sections)
- Signal the video is well-structured

### Reusable Template Block

Build this once, paste it in every video. Include:
- Product/service links and CTAs
- Brief credibility statement (who you are, why anyone should listen)
- Social links
- Media/sponsorship contact (if relevant)
- Legal disclosure (if needed)

Example:

```

```

### What NOT to Do

- No keyword-stuffed paragraphs for SEO — YouTube doesn't weight description text heavily
- No walls of hashtags
- No begging for likes/subscribes in the first line
- No writing a unique 500-word description per video — it's wasted effort

## THUMBNAIL + TITLE PAIRING

The most important rule: **they tell different halves of the same story.**

| Thumbnail | Title | Why it works |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Shocked face + "it's over" | "Bill Gates just got caught in 4K.." | Thumbnail = emotion, Title = who/what |
| Graph with arrows + "PICK ONE" | "The 2 things every platform does differently" | Thumbnail = visual hook, Title = context |
| Face + "100x FASTER" | "Ethernet is DEAD??" | Thumbnail = claim, Title = stakes |
| Multiple poses + "GET OBSESSED" | "26 Harsh Lessons I Learned in 2025" | Thumbnail = energy, Title = format/structure |

### The Test

Cover the title. Does the thumbnail make you curious?
Cover the thumbnail. Does the title make you curious?
If YES to both, and they feel incomplete alone but complete together — you've got it.
