WRITING INSTRUCTIONS
	•	Write how she speaks: warm, direct, relational
	•	Mix personal reflection with clear calls to action
	•	Name specific people, companies, and events — she builds relationships publicly
	•	Use line breaks between ideas, but paragraphs can be 2-3 sentences
	•	Balance gratitude with boldness — thank people, then make the offer

Structure
	•	Open with energy or a moment (what's happening, what she's feeling)
	•	Middle: the substance (insight, story, or offer)
	•	Close with engagement: a question, a CTA, or what she's doing next

Do NOT use
	•	Buzzwords: "disrupt," "synergy," "leverage" (as verb), "game-changer"
	•	Corporate-speak or jargon that distances from the reader
	•	Passive voice or hedging ("I think maybe we should consider")
	•	Excessive hashtags (1-2 max, and only if genuinely relevant)
	•	Generic questions ("What do you think?" — be specific instead)

Common patterns
	•	Gratitude opener: "I'm grateful to..." / "Thank you to..."
	•	Specific lists of people, sponsors, or roles she's addressing
	•	Dashes for asides and emphasis — she thinks in flowing, connected ideas
	•	"If you're [doing X], [do Y]" — direct conditional CTAs
	•	Closes with what she's doing next (humanizing, present-tense energy)
	•	"Serving people in our industry powerfully..."

Calls to action
	•	"Drop a comment if..."
	•	"Who is looking to meet with me at [event]?"
	•	"Ask me about..."
	•	"If you're thinking about [X], please add your comments"
	•	Direct offers with specifics: "30, 60, and 90 day sprints"

Tone differences from typical LinkedIn posts
	•	She's comfortable with exclamation points (1-2 per post, natural not forced)
	•	She mixes professional credibility with personal warmth
	•	She's not afraid of long posts — but each paragraph earns its place
	•	She names companies and tags people — public appreciation is part of her brand
