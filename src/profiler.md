# Marky — Profiler (Brand & Content Strategy Onboarding)

This stage produces **two separate documents** for each client:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **profile.md** | Everything about their **business** that won't change: ICP, JTBD, authority, voice, constraints, messaging pillars, recording setup. Filled from the questionnaire below. Stable reference. |
| **strategy.md** | **Content strategy** — an **active document** we update as we learn more. Includes: social post (channel announcement), UVP, and other content strategy (platforms, format, cadence, what to test, etc.). |

Both live in `projects/<ClientName>/`. Downstream (ideate, edit, distribute) use **profile.md** as the "brain" for business context; **strategy.md** is the living content plan.

## Before you start: deep research on a new person/brand

When profiling someone new, do **public research first** so you can pre-fill as much of the questionnaire as possible. Flag anything you can't confirm with `*NEEDS ANSWER*` or `*NEEDS CONFIRMATION*` for the client interview.

**What to gather:**

1. **Primary presence**
   - Website, landing page, or main link-in-bio. Note: one-sentence description of what they do, services/products, pricing or "contact for quote," CTA (book a call, send message, etc.).
   - If they're under a larger org (e.g. Edward Jones, a franchise): org name, their role, and any compliance/positioning constraints mentioned.

2. **Professional identity**
   - LinkedIn: headline, About, experience, credentials, how they describe their ideal client or "who I help."
   - Other professional profiles (company directory, speaker bio, podcast guest page): same fields, plus any repeated phrases or positioning.

3. **Social and content**
   - Which platforms they're on (LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Facebook, X). Whether they post or just have a profile.
   - Sample of recent posts: topics, tone (formal/casual, educational/salesy), what performs (if visible: likes, comments, shares).
   - Any existing content (videos, podcasts, newsletters): format, length, style. Note what they say about their audience or "who this is for."

4. **Offer and funnel**
   - What they sell (coaching, advisory, course, retainer, etc.) and how it's framed (packages, tiers, "book a call").
   - Any lead magnets, waitlists, or "next step" CTAs. Primary CTA from their main page or profile.

5. **Audience and positioning**
   - Who they say they help (job titles, life stage, industry, geography if relevant).
   - How they differentiate (vs. competitors, vs. "doing it yourself"). Any recurring phrases or pillars (e.g. "one advisor, one plan").

6. **Voice and boundaries**
   - Tone from copy and posts (direct, warm, technical, irreverent, etc.).
   - Topics they avoid or disclaim (compliance, politics, etc.). Any "never" or "we don't" statements.

**Where to look (checklist):**
- [ ] Their website / main URL
- [ ] LinkedIn profile and recent activity
- [ ] Other social handles (IG, TikTok, YouTube, etc.)
- [ ] Google search: `"[their name]"` and `"[business name]"` for bios, interviews, press
- [ ] If B2B or regulated: company/firm page, compliance or "about" language

**After research:** Create or open `projects/<ClientName>/profile.md`. Fill in every question where you have a clear answer from research. For the rest, insert the question and add `*NEEDS ANSWER*` or `*NEEDS CONFIRMATION*` so the interview has a clear agenda. Create or update `strategy.md` when you have enough to draft social post, UVP, and content plan (e.g. after first interview or after ideate has run).

## Output: profile.md (stable)

From the questionnaire, **profile.md** contains:

- **ICP Summary** — who buys, why, and when
- **JTBD Map** — functional + emotional jobs, pains, gains
- **Messaging Pillars** — 3–5 themes to anchor all content
- **Authority Map** — topics × expertise × energy
- **Voice Profile** — tone, style, boundaries, natural language patterns
- **Content Constraints** — what NOT to talk about, what NOT to sound like
- **Platform Strategy** — where to publish, in what format (can also be summarized in strategy.md)
- **Recording Profile** — setup, comfort level, preferred format

---

## Output: strategy.md (active document)

**strategy.md** holds the content strategy and is updated as we learn more. It includes:

1. **Social post** (channel announcement) — for friends/family
2. **UVP** (Unique Value Proposition) — channel positioning, one-liner
3. **Other content strategy** — platforms to prioritize, format (short-form, talking head, etc.), cadence, what to test, content pillars for the channel, etc.

Use the templates below to fill **strategy.md**. Pull from **profile.md** and (if available) the client's **ideas.json** (seed keywords and long-tail user search terms).

---

### 1. Social post (channel announcement) → strategy.md

**Purpose:** A post for the creator to share with friends/family announcing their channel. Focus on the **viewer's job** (why they'd come to the channel), not the creator's paid offer.

**Template:**

```
Hi all,

I'm making content for [ICP — who the channel is for] who want to [job the viewer is trying to get done by watching, e.g. understand their options on X and Y]. [Optional: one sentence on pains → gains from the channel, e.g. "A lot of people show up feeling X; they leave with Y."]

I cover topics like:

- [keyword 1]
- [keyword 2]
- [keyword 3]
- [keyword 4]
- [keyword 5]

For example, I make videos like:

- [user_search_term 1]
- [user_search_term 2]
- [user_search_term 3]
- [user_search_term 4]
- [user_search_term 5]

You can follow me at

- LinkedIn: ...
- Facebook: ...
- Instagram: ...
- TikTok: ...
- YouTube: ...
```

**How to fill it out:**
- **[ICP]** — From profile.md section 2 (Ideal Customer Profile). Use the same audience the creator sells to, but phrase for "people who would watch," e.g. "individuals, families, and business owners."
- **[Job]** — The viewer's job: what they want to accomplish by consuming the content (e.g. "understand their options on wealth, retirement, and legacy"). Not the paid outcome the creator delivers.
- **Pains → gains sentence** — From profile.md section 3 (pains/gains). Keep it about the channel experience: what viewers feel when they arrive vs. what they get from the content. Omit if it feels redundant with the rest.
- **Keywords (5)** — From the client's `ideas.json` → `search_terms.terms` (seed keywords). Pick 5 that span their pillars.
- **User search terms (5)** — From `ideas.json` → `filtered_topics.topics[].user_search_term`. Pick 5 high-intent or virality-sorted examples. These are the long-tail queries the videos aim to rank for.
- **Follow links** — Creator fills in their handles/URLs.

Use "- " (dash space) for all list items. Start with "Hi all,".

---

### 2. UVP (Unique Value Proposition) → strategy.md

**Purpose:** One-sentence positioning for the **channel** (the content product), not the paid service. Use for bios, one-liners, and consistency across platforms.

**Template:**

```
For [target customer],
who [statement of need or opportunity],
[my/our] [channel/show name] is [product category],
that [statement of benefit].
```

**How to fill it out:**
- **Target customer** — Same ICP as the social post (who the channel is for).
- **Need or opportunity** — What they want (e.g. "want to understand their options on X") and/or what's blocking them (e.g. "feel overwhelmed or unsure who to trust"). From profile.md ICP + pains.
- **Product category** — What the channel is, e.g. "educational short-form content," "a no-pitch resource," "a video series."
- **Statement of benefit** — What the viewer gets: clearer options, confidence to take the next step, learning without sales pitch, etc. From profile.md gains, framed as content outcome not client outcome.

**Example (financial advisor channel):**

For individuals, families, and business owners  
who want to understand their options on wealth, retirement, and legacy but feel overwhelmed or unsure who to trust,  
my channel is educational short-form content  
that gives you clearer options and more confidence to take the next step—without the sales pitch.

---

### 3. Other content strategy → strategy.md

Add to **strategy.md** as you learn more: primary platforms, format (e.g. sub-35s direct-to-camera), posting cadence, experiments to run, content pillars for the channel, what "good" looks like for this creator, etc. Update this section after interviews, after ideate runs, and when performance or feedback suggests changes.
